Notes:

- Open with Visual Studio 2022 > Open project > run (published files also included) 

- Card and Provider infomation saved to .txt file in Data folder.

- Given more time, I would have loved to add more data validations and error handling for different cases. I would have also liked to add 'edit' functionality for Provider and Card records.
